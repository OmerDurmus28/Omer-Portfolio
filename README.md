## 📊 Data Projects

### 🟢 R Studio Projects

- **Exploratory Data Analysis on Ryanair Flight Reviews**  
  In this project, I explored customer review data from Ryanair to understand what drives passenger satisfaction.  
  • Cleaned and structured the data using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `readr`  
  • Performed t-tests and multivariate linear regression to identify satisfaction patterns  
  • Visualized insights with `ggplot2`, and wrapped the workflow using `broom`, `car`, and `psych`

- **Unraveling Life Satisfaction in Türkiye**  
  This study focuses on identifying the key determinants of life satisfaction in Türkiye using data from the World Values Survey.  
  • Filtered and cleaned Türkiye’s sample using `haven`, `labelled`, and `tidyverse`  
  • Built multivariate regression models to analyze the impact of variables like income, education, and institutional trust  
  • Visualized findings using `sjPlot` and `ggplot2`

### 🟣 SQL for Data Science – USDA Agricultural Data Insights
In this project, I worked with open datasets from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to extract actionable insights using SQL. I answered analytical questions using DQL, DDL, and DML statements.
Performed tasks: 
- Queried total milk, cheese, coffee, honey, and yogurt production by year and state  
- Used JOIN, WHERE, IN, GROUP BY, and CAST clauses to handle multi-table queries  
- Identified production gaps and regional differences  
- Applied filtering logic to support decision-making in agricultural departments
